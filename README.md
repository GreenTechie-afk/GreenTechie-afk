## 👋 Hey, I'm Kevin,

Welcome to my corner of GitHub — where engineering, systems thinking, and creativity collide. I'm an Environmental Engineering student passionate about designing and building tools that make sustainability more accessible, more honest, and way more interesting.

## 🚀 What I Do

I’m on a mission to discover solutions that blend technical skills, systems thinking, and holistic approaches for the sake of bettering the quality of life around the world. 

- 🌱 **Smart Plant Water Reminder** – A Wi-Fi-enabled soil moisture system with a 3D-printed mushroom enclosure
- ☀️ **Solar-Powered Weather Station** — Modular IoT system for field data collection and power management

*(More projects coming soon as I expand my environmental engineering portfolio.)*

## 🔧 Tools & Tech I Use

**Microcontrollers & IoT:** 
Arduino Uno, ESP8266 (NodeMCU), Raspberry Pi 5, Sensor arrays

**Software & Programming:** 
C++, Python, HTML/CSS, Linux (Fedora + Asahi), Fusion 360, AutoCAD, Revit, Adobe Photoshop 

**Domain & Skills:** 
Environmental sensing, Prototyping, 3D modeling, UI/UX prototyping, Data visualization, Hydraulic & environmental modeling

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Clarity. Functionality. Realness.  
I like building things that *look as good as they work* — blending hands-on prototyping with a design mindset that values usability, storytelling, and purpose.  
Even the scrappy builds deserve elegance.

## 📚 Currently Learning

- ⚙️ Building **privacy-respecting local AI models**
