## 👋 Hey, I'm Kevin,

Welcome to my corner of GitHub — where engineering meets sustainability, creativity, and edge. I'm an Environmental Engineering student passionate about designing and building tools that make sustainability more accessible, more honest, and way more interesting.

## 🚀 What I Do

I’m on a mission to discover solutions that blend technical skills, systems thinking, and holistic approaches for the sake of bettering the quality of life around the world. 

- 🌱 **Smart Plant Water Reminder** – A Wi-Fi-enabled soil moisture system with a 3D-printed mushroom enclosure
- ☀️ **Solar-Powered Weather Station** — Modular IoT system for field data collection and power management

*(More projects coming soon as I expand my environmental engineering portfolio.)*

## 🔧 Tools & Tech I Use

**Microcontrollers:** Arduino Uno, ESP8266 (NodeMCU), Raspberry Pi 5  
**Languages:** C++, Python, HTML/CSS, Bash  
**Specialties:** Sensor calibration, 3D modeling (Fusion 360 / AutoCAD), UI/UX prototyping, data visualization, systems design  

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Clarity. Functionality. Realness.  
I like building things that *look as good as they work* — blending hands-on prototyping with a design mindset that values usability, storytelling, and purpose.  
Even the scrappy builds deserve elegance.

## 📚 Currently Learning
