## 👋 Hey, I'm KG-

Welcome to my corner of GitHub — where engineering meets sustainability, creativity, and edge. I'm an Environmental Engineering student passionate about designing and building tools that make sustainability more accessible, more honest, and way more interesting.

## 🚀 What I Do

I’m on a mission to discover solutions that blend technical skills, systems thinking, and holistic approaches for the sake of bettering the quality of life around the world. 

- 🌱 Smart Plant Water Reminder – A Wi-Fi-enabled soil moisture system with a 3D-printed mushroom enclosure
- 🧪 EcoEgo Evaluator – A local desktop app (with optional GPT integration) to rewrite and assess climate communication strategies

## 🔧 Tools & Tech I Use

- Microcontrollers: Arduino Uno, NodeMCU (ESP8266), Raspberry Pi 5  
- Languages: C++, Python, HTML/CSS, Bash  
- Other skills: 3D modeling, sensor calibration, UI/UX experimentation, grassroots prototyping

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

I’m a big believer in clarity, simplicity, and being real about the messiness of engineering. My projects aim to be bold, usable, and visually sharp — even when they’re built with duct tape and a dream.
